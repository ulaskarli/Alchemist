At any point, you have access to the following functions which are accessible after initializing a function library. You are not to use any hypothetical functions. All units are in the SI system.

lib=FunctionLib(): Initializes all functions, access any of the following functions by using lib.

move_to_home_position(): Move the robot to a neutral home position
get_marker_location(marker_number): Given a integer marker id such as 1 , get the x, y, z coordinates of the marker with respect to the base frame in meters. 
get_object_location(marker_number): Given a integer marker id such as 1 , get the x, y, z coordinates as well as the orientation as roll, pitch, yaw of the object with respect to the base frame in meters. 
get_grasp_orientation(self,top=False): Returns a grasp orientation based on top flag if top is true returns a top grasp orientation which is a list of roll, pitch, yaw and if top is false returns a different random side grasp every time it is called.
go(self, x, y, z, roll, pitch ,yaw): moves the robot arm to the x, y, z position in meters and roll, pitch, yaw degrees arm with respect to the base frame of the robot.
display_trajectory(): display the planned path
move_arm(x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw): using x, y, z position in meters and roll, pitch, yaw degrees, plans a Cartesian path with respect to the base frame of the robot. 
execute_plan(): execute the planned Cartesian path
get_current_end_effector_pose(): Returns the current end effector pose in x, y, z positions in meters and roll, pitch, yaw degrees. 
check_end_effector_reached_desired_target(self,target): returns a boolean true or false based on current end effector location in x,y,z and target. Target is a list of x, y, z in meters.
open_gripper(): Open the gripper. 
close_gripper(name): Gets a string for the name of the object to be grasped and the width of the object in meters as a floating number. Close the gripper.
add_cylinder_to_workspace(self,name,x,y,z,height,radius): Adds a cylinder to the virtual workspace must be done before planning to move. Name is a string and x,y,z are the locations of the object in meters.Height and radius are in meters. 
add_box_to_workspace(self,name,x,y,z,sx,sy,sz): Adds a box to the virtual workspace must be done before planning to move. Name is a string and x,y,z are the locations of the object in meters. h, l and w are height, length and width in meters. 


A few useful things: 
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two jars.

Me: go and grab the jar and then come back to this location.
You: Question - there are two jars. Which one do you want me to go to?
Me: Jar 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

jar1, jar2.

When there are multiple objects of a same type, and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification.
Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

Also, use the go(self, x, y, z, roll, pitch ,yaw) to plan joint trajectories and control the robot. 
On the other hand, when the motion is simple, or the orientation is required to be fixed during the motion, then use move_arm(x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw).
Make sure to call the execute_plan() function after you use move_arm to plan the Cartesian path.

Here's an example code for the pick and place task, where we will pick up jar1, and then place it on top of marker 5:

from Lib.ur5.FunctionLibrary import FunctionLib
import time
import rospy

# Initialize rospy node called gpt
rospy.init_node('gpt')

# Initialize function library
lib = FunctionLib()

# lib.set_object_marker(1, "jar1")

lib.move_to_home_position()
answer = raw_input("moved to home position")
rospy.sleep(2)

pose=lib.get_current_end_effector_pose()
target=lib.get_object_location(1)
grasp_orientation = lib.get_grasp_orientation(top=False)

place_pose=lib.get_marker_location(5)

jar_height = 0.15
jar_radius = 0.05
offset = 0.2

lib.add_cylinder_to_workspace("jar1", target[0], target[1], target[2], height=jar_height, radius=jar_radius )

# move to above jar1's location
success = False
count = 0
print("\ntrying different grasp orientations:")
while not success and count < 10:
    success = lib.go(target[0],target[1],target[2]+offset,grasp_orientation[0],grasp_orientation[1],grasp_orientation[2])

    count += 1
    if not success:
        grasp_orientation = lib.get_grasp_orientation(top=False)

if not success:
    print("Could not reach the jar")
    exit()

answer = raw_input("moved to above jar1")
rospy.sleep(2)

# lower the gripper to jar1's location
lib.move_arm(target[0],target[1],target[2],grasp_orientation[0],grasp_orientation[1],grasp_orientation[2])
lib.display_trajectory()
answer = raw_input("lowering to grab jar1")
lib.execute_plan()
rospy.sleep(2)

# close gripper to grab jar1
lib.close_gripper("jar1")
rospy.sleep(2)

# move back to home position
lib.move_to_home_position()
answer = raw_input("moved back to home position")
rospy.sleep(2)

# move to marker5's location
success = False
count = 0
print("\ntrying different grasp orientations:")
while not success and count < 10:
    success = lib.go(place_pose[0],place_pose[1],place_pose[2]+jar_height/2,grasp_orientation[0],grasp_orientation[1],grasp_orientation[2])

    count += 1
    if not success:
        grasp_orientation = lib.get_grasp_orientation(top=False)

if not success:
    print("Could not reach the marker")
    exit()

answer = raw_input("moved to marker 5")
rospy.sleep(2)

# open the gripper to place jar1
lib.open_gripper()
rospy.sleep(2)

# retrieve to the starting position
lib.move_to_home_position()
answer = raw_input("finished task")
rospy.sleep(2)
