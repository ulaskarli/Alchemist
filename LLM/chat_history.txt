In this script, we use the add_cylinder_to_workspace function to add the given graduated cylinders and beaker to the robot's workspace at the specified marker locations. We then call the move_to_home_position function to move the manipulator back to its home position.By using the function library you are provided.

TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting Make sure to use marker location. If you wrote a function, remember to add a example function call at the end. make sure to move back to home after the task is finished.The issue is with the invalid object names we are using. We need to correct the object names. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from Lib.ur5.FunctionLibrary import FunctionLib

# Initialize function library
lib = FunctionLib()

# Adding the graduated cylinders and the beaker to the workspace

lib.move_to_home_position()

print("All objects added to the workspace and the arm returned to home.")
```

Instead of using 'graduated_cylinder_25mL', 'graduated_cylinder_50mL', 'graduated_cylinder_100mL', 'graduated_cylinder_250mL', 'beaker_500mL', 'graduated_cylinder_10mL', it should be correct names separated by space 'graduated cylinder 25mL', 'graduated cylinder 50mL', 'graduated cylinder 100mL', 'graduated cylinder 250mL', 'beaker 500mL', 'graduated cylinder 10mL'. So, I just replaced the underscore with a whitespace in all the object names.By using the function library you are provided. Write a function to grab the 250 ml graduated cylinder and bring it close to the beaker. Now, gently transfer the contents of the cylinder into the beaker. Subsequently, take the cylinder back to its initial position and gently place it down. Now repeat the task for the 100 ml cylinder, 50 ml cylinder and the 25 ml cylinder (in place of the 250 ml cylinder). If you wrote a function, remember to add a example function call at the end. make sure to move back to home after the task is finished.```python

This script first defines the function transfer_content that moves the UR5 robot to the location of the given cylinder, pick it up, pour its content into the beaker, and then puts the cylinder back to its original location. 

Then, it initializes a list of cylinder names and iterates over this list, calling the transfer_content function for each cylinder.

Finally, it moves the robot to its home position.By using the function library you are provided. Please note that when someone asks to gently place down a cylinder, they are expecting the robot to drop it at the level from which the cylinder was grabbed. make sure to move back to home after the task is finished.```python

This code first grasps the "beaker 500mL" and then move it 1 cm to the left. After that, it moves the beaker 1 cm to the right (from the original location). Then it moves it 1cm up from the original location and move 1 cm down from the original location. After all these movements, the beaker is placed back to its original location and the gripper is released. Lastly, the arm is moved to the home position. All the moves are done gently to ensure no spillage from the beaker.By using the function library you are provided. stop the robot make sure to move back to home after the task is finished.from Lib.ur5.FunctionLibrary import FunctionLib

In the above code, we first call the stop method from our function library to stop the robot arm immediately. 
Once it's safe to do so, we move the robot arm back to its home position by calling the move_to_home_position method.By using the function library you are provided. stop the robot make sure to move back to home after the task is finished.```python

This code is using the stop function to immediately stop the robot. 
After stopping the robot, it sends the robot back to the default home position using the move_to_home_position function.By using the function library you are provided. Now, please take the 500 ml beaker and gently move it 1 cm to the left, right, up and down.

This code is first getting the location and dimensions of the "beaker 500mL". Then it moves the robot to the top of the beaker and moves down to grasp the beaker. Afterwards, the opened gripper is closed to grasp the beaker. Then, the robot moves the beaker 1 cm to the left, then to the right, then upwards, and then downwards. After these movements, the beaker is moved back to its original location. Finally, the gripper is opened to release the beaker at the place from where it was initially picked.

This code is similar to the previous one but after grasping the beaker, it first moves the beaker 10 cm up. Then similar left, right, up and down movements of 1 cm each are performed as before but these are done relative to the new location - 10 cm above the original position of the beaker. Finally, it moves the beaker 10 cm down to its initial position where it's released. The robot then move to its home position.By using the function library you are provided. Now, please grab the 10 ml graduated cylinder and bring it close to the beaker. Subsequently, gently transfer the cylinder's contents into the beaker.

In this script, I first get the graduated cylinder's name and initial location. Then I pour the cylinder's content into the beaker named "beaker 500mL".

At the end, the robot moves back to its home position.By using the function library you are provided.

In this script, I first get the 500 ml beaker's location and dimensions. Then the robot arm is moved to the location of the beaker. The gripper is closed to grip the beaker. After that, the beaker is moved 10 cm upwards using the go function. After moving up, then the beaker is rotated 7 degrees in either direction for 3 times. Then, the beaker is moved back to its original location. At the end, the gripper is opened to release the beaker and the robot arm is moved back to the home position.By using the function library you are provided.  Now, take the 500 ml beaker 10 cm in the upward direction and gently move it 4 cm in all directions for a total of 3 times. Subsequently, gently bring the beaker back to its original position and leave it at the level at which it was grabbed make sure to move back to home after the task is finished.```python

This Python code uses the function library to grasp the 500ml beaker, then lifts it 10cm upwards. The beaker is then moved 4cm in all directions three times. After the movements, the code brings the beaker back gently to its original position at the level it was grabbed. Finally, the beaker is released and the robot arm moves back to the home position.By using the function library you are provided. Now, please grab the 500 ml beaker and place it near marker 10 by gently leaving it at the level from which it was grabbed. make sure to move back to home after the task is finished.```python
